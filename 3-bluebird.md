# What is bluebird
	- Not the only library that I'd recommend
	- Q, etc

# Why do I like it?
	- I like it because:
		- Has an extensive, and somewhat functional API that I like
		- It has good error handling
		- Plays nicely with a lot of other libraries, including native promises
	- Hopefully by the end, you'll see why I like it!
