# Promises tutorial

A quick introduction to promises and a quick detailing of their history, their quirks and how to use / leverage them effectively. 

The tutorial should be appropriate for beginners and those less experienced in JS. 

All of the js examples can be ran and edited if you wish to play around with them. 

## To run an example

Install node dependencies (bluebird and a colour library)

`npm install`

Then run `node` on the filename like so:

`node filename.js`
